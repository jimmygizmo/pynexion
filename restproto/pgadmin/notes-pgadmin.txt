One image with 50MM pulls is available at - this seems like the most official image:
https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4/

----------

In this startup example, we use the -p option (necessary on MacOS) and since this pgadmin4 container listens
on port 80 (which we don't want to bind to on the Mac) we map this outside the contiainer to port 5555.o

<CONTAINER_ID> is obtained from the output of the build process. Of course, there are other ways to do this.

Startup example:
docker run -p 5555:80 -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=username@domain.com -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=secret <CONTAINER_ID>

Then you can open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5555
