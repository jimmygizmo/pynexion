The backend is likely where Python maintenance processes will be run. It may eventually have its own
REST api to control such processes. For now it simply has a Dockerfile, based off the same one used
by the 'service' container as it is a good Ubuntu Dockerfile for general Python support. Here we have
simply commented out the few parts at the end specific to the 'service' Flask app.

Anything commented out in this way was done so using eight pund signs, like:
########

If you re-enable the lines commented out like that, you will basically have the 'service' Dockerfile.

This will all change soon when both the 'service' Dockerfile is evolved further and/or when a proper
Dockerfile is made specifically for 'backend'.
