This 'datavolume' directory is here as a placeholder and will be used by all running containers as a shared data volume.
The Postgress database data files will be stored here. Other data and configuration files used by other parts
of the app may be stored here. At a later point, if it makes sense, separate volumes will be used for distinct
purposes, but to get started, just this single volume should be sufficient. The main goal is to persist data, but
a secondary purpose is to allow filesystem data sharing between running containers.
