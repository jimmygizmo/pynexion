Just out of curiosity I wanted to see what dependencies came with aiohttp.
Here they are:

aiohttp==3.5.4
async-timeout==3.0.1
attrs==19.1.0
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.8
multidict==4.5.2
yarl==1.3.0


On a related note, here are the dependencies that came with pylint, which was installed to
allow some important VSCode features to operate:

astroid==2.2.5
isort==4.3.20
lazy-object-proxy==1.4.1
mccabe==0.6.1
pylint==2.3.1
six==1.12.0
typed-ast==1.4.0
wrapt==1.11.1
