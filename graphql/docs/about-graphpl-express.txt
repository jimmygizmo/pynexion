graphqlHTTP const name is just a convention for using express-graphql
express-graphql allows express to understand graphql and provides a simple way to create an express server which runs the graphql API.
How?
We use it as middle-ware on a single route and this route will be like an endpoint to interact with our graphql data.

We will have one supercharged endpoint to rule them all (as compared to REST with potentially many many endpoints)
We will send all graphql queries to this endpoint.
