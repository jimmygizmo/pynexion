cd ...../project/graphql
mkdir server
cd server
npm init - enter to all questions is fine

npm install express
* Created a .gitignore for node projects
START editing server/app.js
With respect to the callback function for app.listen, an ES6 function is just () => {}

RUN: node app
BETTER: Install nodemon, THEN CAN: nodemon app
SO: npm install nodemon -g (globally not just for this project)

INSTALL graphql, express-graphql
npm install graphql
npm install express-graphql

NEXT we need to pass the schema as an option to graphqlHTTP init.
inside dir server/, mkdir schema
new file schema.js in here

SCHEMA is in place in code but we need to dummy up a resolve() using an array and
we will use lodash to simplify accessing the dummy data (array)
npm install lodash
Now need to test it so need to use graphiqal tool. It is invoked in the middleware app.use attributes,

GraphQLID is more flexible than GraphQLString for id purposes. Then we can use an int OR a string.


**** SKIPPED SOME STEPS HERE. MAYBE ADD IN LATER. ****

Now working on React client app.
Basic react parent and booklist component are now stubbed out and rendering.
Time to install stuff for Apollo graphql client. Will not install apollo-boost
bundle. Better to see the individual installs.
This has a few packages that the tutorial does not hint at. And the tutorial
just installs apollo-boost .. which actually I will also do at the end in case
it also does some configuration I need to more easily follow the tutorial.

npm install apollo-client
npm install apollo-cache-inmemory
npm install apollo-link-http
npm install apollo-link-error
npm install apollo-link
npm install graphql-tag
npm install react-apollo
npm install graphql

npm install apollo-boost
GOOD. NO PROBLEMS WITH ANY OF THESE.
