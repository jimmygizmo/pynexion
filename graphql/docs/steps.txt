cd ...../project/graphql
mkdir server
cd server
npm init - enter to all questions is fine

npm install express
* Created a .gitignore for node projects
START editing server/app.js
With respect to the callback function for app.listen, an ES6 function is just () => {}

RUN: node app
BETTER: Install nodemon, THEN CAN: nodemon app
SO: npm install nodemon -g (globally not just for this project)

INSTALL graphql, express-graphql
npm install graphql
npm install express-graphql

NEXT we need to pass the schema as an option to graphqlHTTP init.
inside dir server/, mkdir schema
new file schema.js in here
