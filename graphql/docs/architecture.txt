CLIENT (Browser)
React App
Appollo (sort of the glue layer for graphql - enables react to use graphql)



SERVER (Node.js)
Express App (Minimalist web application framework)
GraphQL Server (Manages data retreival and manipulation)
- Where we will describe the data types and their relationships of the graph
= The various entry points into the graph and what information it offers



DATABASE
MongoDB (hosted on MLab)
- Where data will be stored


---------
GraphQL can just as easily be used with Angular or Vue. (Unsure if Appollo would be used for all tho)


---------
Graphiql is a tool, a dummy front-end to make queries during dev/test.
Pronounced 'graphical'.
In this tutorial, it is served up from the same Express server.
